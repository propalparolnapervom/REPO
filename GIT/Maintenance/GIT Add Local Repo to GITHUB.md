# GIT ADD LOCAL REPO TO GITHUB.md

## Overall GITHUB information

These are common files in open source projects so to make starting a new project easier, GitHub provides an option for creating them for you.

1. A **readme** explains what the project is, how to use it, and often times, how to contribute (though sometimes there is an extra file, 'CONTRIBUTING.md', for those details).

2. A **.gitignore** is a list of files that Git should not track, for instance, files with passwords!

3. A **license** file is the type of license you put on your project. This lets others know how they can use it. Information on the types is here: [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/)


## ADD LOCAL REPO "test_dir" TO GITHUB

### 1. Create a Remote Repository

1.1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/), log in, and click the '+' in the top right and then click 'New repository'.

1.2. Give it a name that matches your local repository's name (test_dir) and a short description.

1.3. Make it public. This means it'll be listed on your public profile.

1.4. Don't initialize with a README because we already have a file, locally, named 'readme.txt'. This is a helper option from GitHub if you hadn't already made it.

1.5. Leave '.gitignore' and 'license' set to 'none'. We won't use them this tutorial.

1.6. Click create repository!


### 2. Connect your Local to your Remote




### 3. Push Work to your Remote
