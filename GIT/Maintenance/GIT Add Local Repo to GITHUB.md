## GIT ADD LOCAL REPO TO GITHUB.md

**Overall GITHUB information** 

These are common files in open source projects so to make starting a new project easier, GitHub provides an option for creating them for you.

1. A **readme** explains what the project is, how to use it, and often times, how to contribute (though sometimes there is an extra file, 'CONTRIBUTING.md', for those details).

2. A **.gitignore** is a list of files that Git should not track, for instance, files with passwords!

3. A **license** file is the type of license you put on your project. This lets others know how they can use it. Information on the types is here: [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/)
