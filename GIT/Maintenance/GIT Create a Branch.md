## GIT BRANCH CREATION

### BRANCH OVERALL INFO

Git repositories use branches to isolate work when needed. 

It's common practice when working on a project or with others on a project to create a **branch** to keep your working changes in. This way you can do your work while the main, commonly named 'master', branch stays stable. When the work on your branch is finished you merge it back into the 'master' master branch.
