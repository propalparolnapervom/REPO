## GIT FORK REMOTE REPO

### FORK/CLONE OVERALL INFO

When you fork a repository, you're creating a copy of it on your GitHub account. Your forked copy begins its life as a remote repositoryâ€”it exists just on your GitHub account, not on your computer. Forks are used for creating your own version of a project (this diversion from the original is like taking a fork in the road) or contributing back your changes (such as bug fixes or new features) to the original project.

To get a forked repository from your GitHub account onto your computer you clone it. This cloning action copies the remote repository onto your computer so that you can work on it locally.
